        <h2>EDUCATION & COURSES</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>2019-2023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PhD Computer Science, King’s College London, United Kingdom</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a Java programme with different algorithms to automatically learn additional knowledge from arbitrary planning
                domains, and assessed the usability of the learned knowledge by running experiments.</li>
            <li>Collected and analyzed the experiment results to see how the algorithms can be improved. Evaluated and presented the
                results using hypothesis testing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2015-2019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSci (Hons) Computer Science, King’s College London, United Kingdom</h3>
        <p>Grade: 1st <br />
        Modules include: software engineering, software architecture and design, database systems, artificial intelligence</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used software engineering concepts and various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++ to solve a wide
                range of problems, including using the knowledge about database systems to build a website for student records, and
                implementing decision-making theories using Python to win a Pacman game.</li>
            <li>Learned about handling database through study of relational data models and SQL as part of database systems.</li>
            <li>Exposure to basic machine learning concepts such as classification, clustering, and neural networks through study of
                artificial intelligence and pattern recognition.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2013-Dec 2014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore-Cambridge GCE A levels, Anglo-Chinese Junior College, Singapore</h3>
        <p>Modules include: mathematics(A), economics(A), and physics(B)</p>
        <h3>2011-Dec 2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore-Cambridge GCE O levels, Singapore Chinese Girls’ School, Singapore</h3>
        <p>Modules include: mathematics(A1) and additional mathematics(A1)</p>
        
        <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>Aug 2022 - Present&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exam Script Scanner, King's College London</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Read exam scripts review requests from students, found relevant exam scripts from the department, scanned the scripts
                when necessary, and sent them to students.</li>
            <li>Communicated with the relevant department when a script could not be found.</li>
            <li>Organised meetings between teaching staffs and students if the students have queries about their marks.</li>
            <li>Kept track of students' requests using a shared document to avoid having multiple staffs working on the same request.</li>
            <li>Worked largely unsupervised and often completed tasks ahead of schedule, demonstrating self-motivation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sept 2020 - Present&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching Assistant, King's College London</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintained close working relationships with students and teaching staffs. Answered queries from students, observed issues in
                small group tutorials and relayed these problems to the relevant teaching staffs.</li>
            <li>Tutored students individually and in small groups to reinforce learning concepts from core subjects.</li>
            <li>Performed administrative activities such as taking attendance, marking assignments, and second-marking exams. Invigilated
                exams when required.</li> 
        </ul>

        <hr />
        <ul>
            <li>Published and presented a paper with the title “Learning Macro-Actions to Improve the Relaxed Planning Graph Heuristic” at
                the Knowledge Engineering for Planning and Scheduling workshop in the 32nd International Conference on Automated
                Planning and Scheduling.</li>
            <li>Completed the Professional Skills for a Globalised World course. Learned about how to work with people with different
                backgrounds and perspectives, and how to make the environment the best for everyone around to feel included and
                supported.</li>
